              The benefits of spices are not only as a cooking ingredient, but can also provide protection for the body against various diseases, ranging from colds, free radicals to heart disease.
              <br />
              It is believed that the risk of various diseases can be suppressed by consuming a variety of spices. One of the benefits of spices is known to be able to reduce damage to body cells and fight inflammation.
              <br /><br /><br />

              1. Cinnamon<br /><br />
              This type of spice is often added to bread and cakes. But you know, cinnamon can not only give a distinctive taste. This spice is also thought to be useful for reducing inflammation symptoms. Research also shows<br /><br />
              that the content of antioxidants and other substances in cinnamon can help control blood sugar levels, cholesterol, blood pressure, and improve brain function. Cinnamon also has antibacterial properties.
              <br /><br />

              2. Turmeric<br /><br />
              Turmeric is indeed quite often used as a spice for Indonesian cuisine. Besides being easy to obtain and being able to give food its own taste, the curcumin content in turmeric has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that
              are good for the health of the body.
              <br /><br />Research shows that turmeric can cure colds, treat scars, relieve arthritis symptoms, reduce cholesterol, prevent senility and cancer, maintain liver and brain function, and overcome infections. <br /><br />

              3. Ginger <br /><br />This one spice is almost always found in cooking, drinks, and traditional herbal medicine. Several studies have shown that ginger has strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and is good for
              relieving nausea, menstrual pain, osteoarthritis, and treating colds. <br /><br />

              4. Garlic <br /><br />This Indonesian people's daily food ingredient turns out to provide extraordinary benefits for controlling blood pressure. According to research, garlic is proven to help lower blood pressure. The allicin
              content in it is thought to make blood vessels dilate and relax more. As a result, blood flow becomes smoother and the pressure in the blood vessels decreases. <br /><br />The benefits of this one spice are also obtained from
              its high antioxidant and antibacterial effects. Several studies have shown that garlic can strengthen the body's immunity, reduce cholesterol, suppress the growth of cancer cells, and prevent heart disease and obesity.<br /><br />

              5. Cardamom<br /><br />
              Apart from consuming garlic, you can also consume cardamom every day for several months to reduce blood pressure. To get the benefits of this spice, you can add cardamom to processed foods, such as cakes, bread, soups and
              other foods.<br /><br />
              Several studies have also found that the benefits of cardamom spices are thought to reduce inflammation, reduce blood cholesterol, and prevent insulin resistance.
              <br /><br />

              6. Basil<br /><br />
              This one spice is usually part of fresh vegetables. Its distinctive aroma and taste not only increase pleasure when eating, but are also reported to help lower blood pressure. However, this research was limited to mice, not
              humans.
              <br /><br />
              In addition, basil is rich in magnesium and contains antioxidants that help your body fight free radicals.
              <br /><br />
              Not only that, the content of substances in basil is also believed to be able to reduce inflammation, help fight infection, strengthen the immune system, and prevent the adverse effects of aging.
              <br /><br /><br /><br />

              Although they can provide a myriad of benefits, in fact the health benefits of spices still require further research, especially if you want to use them as herbal medicine.
